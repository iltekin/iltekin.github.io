Hi, I'm Sezer İltekin 👋🏼
I'm a Full Stack Web Developer 👨🏻‍💻 from Istanbul, Türkiye 🇹🇷

I love to learn, code and produce creative content 💡 This has been my lifestyle since childhood and I will continue to learn and improve myself 🧠 throughout my life.

I've been developing websites and web applications using PHP 🐘 since 2016. You can see a small part of my work on my portfolio page. Along with PHP, of course, I also use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in my projects. In 2021, I decided to switch from Web to Mobile development and nowadays I am writing my codes in Swift language to be an iOS Developer 👨🏻‍💻

You can find me on: Github - HackerRank - LinkedIn - Twitter

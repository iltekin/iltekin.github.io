<p>Hi, I'm Sezer İltekin 👋🏼<br/>
I am a self-taught iOS Developer 👨🏻‍💻</p>

<p>I love to learn, code and produce creative content 💡 This has been my lifestyle since childhood and I will continue to learn and improve myself 🧠 throughout my life.</p>

<p>I've been developing websites and web applications using <code>PHP</code> 🐘 since 2016. You can see a small part of my work on my portfolio page. Along with <code>PHP</code>, of course, I also use <code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code> and <code>JavaScript</code> in my projects. In 2021, I decided to switch from Web to Mobile development and nowadays I am writing my codes in <code>Swift</code> language to be an iOS Developer 👨🏻‍💻</p>
